## ⚡ Project Overview

This is a **frontend-only application** for a marketplace:

- Users can **register/login** and manage their account.  
- Users can **browse, search, and view products**.  
- Users can **post ads with multiple images**.  
- Data is stored in **Firebase Firestore**, images in **Firebase Storage**, and authentication handled by **Firebase Auth**.  

The project uses **domain/feature-based architecture**, meaning each feature (Auth, Products, Post Ads, Profile) owns its own **pages, components, and services** for scalability and maintainability.
